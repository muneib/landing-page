# Landing Page

This project was done for [The Odin Project](https://muneib.github.io/landing-page/) as a mean to practice basic CSS and the Flexbox layout model. 

By looking looking at the code in this repo you can tell that it can be written way better, and I'm totally aware of that, I just started learning CSS, but as the time goes on and I get comfortable writing CSS I will rewrite some of the code, but for now I will put CSS on hold and start learning [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/).
